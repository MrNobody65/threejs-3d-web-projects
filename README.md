This repo consists of my learning projects using Three.js for creating 3d graphic on web pages.

## 1. Getting Strted

Get familiar with basic concepts including scene, camera, renderer, geometry, material, and mesh.

## 2. Create the Earth with Three.js

Use available texture maps to create a vibrating Earth model.

## 3. Fly through a Wireframe Wormhole

Generate a Wireframe Wormhole with glow effect based on a spline.

## 4. Transition Effect

Create transition between scenes with different patterns.

## 5. Add physics to Three.js with Rapier

Add physics by creating rigid bodies, collisions and gravity using Rapier - a library built with Rust.
